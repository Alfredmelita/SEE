🎉 Fun Calculator 🎉
Welcome to the Fun Calculator – a playful and beginner-friendly Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Perfect for learning the basics of input, output, and number operations in Python! 😎

🧠 What It Does
This program:

Prompts the user to enter two numbers.

Calculates:

The sum of the numbers

The difference (first minus second)

The product

(Intended) quotient – division result (currently not implemented in the print section).

Displays the results in the console.

🚀 How to Run It
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

Copy the code into a Python file, for example: fun_calculator.py.

Run it from your terminal or any Python IDE:

bash
Copy
Edit
python fun_calculator.py
Enter two numbers when prompted, and see the magic happen! ✨

📌 Example
bash
Copy
Edit
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Output:

Copy
Edit
12.0      # sum: 10 + 2
8.0       # difference: 10 - 2
20.0      # product: 10 * 2
Note: Division is computed in the code but not displayed in the current version. You'll need to add a print statement to show it.

🛠️ To Do
✅ Add support for division

✅ Print the division result

❌ Handle division by zero gracefully

💡 Improvements You Can Make
Add error handling for division by zero using try...except.

Let the user choose the operation they want to perform.

Make the output more readable with labels.
